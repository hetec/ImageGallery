Simple image gallery with HTML and JQuery
(Just a quick and dirty solution)

Just provide some images to view in the img folder
	-> imgBig = to show each image in lage size
	-> imgTemplates = smale versions of your big images used as preview images
		-> recommended size of the template is: width = 155px, height = 88px

The ammount of images is currently restricted to 100
The number of images has to be set on the top of the script area in the index.html through the variable
numberImg --> Please regard: The number of images specified in numberImg can be lower than the actually number in
the img directory, but it should never be greater than this number.
